commit: 843a1ab384837fbe12f93f57f44e9fc468c0d5a3
tested: elementary OS 5, Xubuntu 20.10, Debian 10
works: elementary OS 5
fails: Xubuntu 20.10, Debian 10
error: Iommu group for "Intel audio controller" not valid
Solution:
- default: It Works to passthrough all other devices on that bus, They seem to be nonessential? But this is not ideal as the Host should control them. (Tested: { iommu group: 9, cpu series: Skylake, Chipset: H110M })
- Hardware: Just buy a USB audio interface
- Software: use JACK audio
- Software: use Scream network audio
